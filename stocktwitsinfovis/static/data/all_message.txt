RT @StockTwits StockTwits Poll: Is the first 10% move in 2010 for the $SPX higher or lower?  5sbtKo ($ES_F)
I must say, the EU is confusing at best.  For starters, who&#39;s in, who&#39;s out?
Would wager to 100% of any Europeans could tell you there are 50 states.
But I&#39;m guessing few than 1% of Amercans could tell you how many nations belong to the EU.
Until recently I was in that 99% majority that did not know, did not care there are 27 EU member states.
But of course, it could not be that simple...
$eurusd as only 16 of the 27 member states actually use the euro as a currency.  
$eurusd 4 of the 11 that do not participate are in the final hurdle phase, known as ERM2--exchance rate mechanism, part deux 
best trade i made last year, not buying an $AMZN Kindle, waiting for $AAPL tablet, patience pays
$usddkk The nice folks in Denmark voted adoption of the euro down in a referendum--believe that was in &#39;08.
ALL EU member states, except Denmark and UK, are required by treaty to join the Economic and Monetary Union, or EMU
As far as I can tell EMU is just yet another name for EuroZone, which &lt;&gt; EU;  EZ = the 16 that actually use the euro currency.
The Balctic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are the other three of the four states actively in ERM2.  Not sure why the hold up.  
ERM2 is a stage where states effectively demonstrate fx stability and adherence to monetary policy guidelines. 
$eurusd I guess the most useful point is the different between EU and EZ--those that use the currency and those that do not.
$eurusd when it comes to evaluating the healthy of the EU economy, I&#39;d suggest you use GDP-weighted numbers based on the EZ only, not EU.
As there is a huge difference in EU GDP vs. EZ GDP.  Namely you drop out GB, SE, HU, CS, PO, RO... but obviously GB is the heavyweight.
